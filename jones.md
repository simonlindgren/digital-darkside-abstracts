## This is part one of our story: AI true crime content on TikTok

The digital afterlife has become an emerging topic in death studies as the dead are increasingly reconstructed through avatars, deathbots and deepfakes. Using existing data, including photographs, films, WhatsApp conversations and sound recordings, to recreate the dead body the digital afterlife holds the promise for immortality yet there are a range of issues and concerns related to the digital afterlife, including the agency of avatars, deathbots and data, privacy and the related right to be forgotten in post-mortem, and the commercialisation of data and commodification of death and digital afterlife. Researchers are exploring these issues but one area that is hitherto under-explored is the use of AI to reconstruct the murdered dead and enable them to tell their stories.

This paper examines TikTok videos which use AI digital afterlife tools to animate photographs or create AI videos of victims and killers from Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman to H. H. Holmes and Dennis Rader. True crime is already considered a morally ambiguous genre with concerns relating to exploitation and sensationalism, and the prioritisation of entertainment over ethical reporting. Undertaking a content analysis of videos and comments posted on them, I explore the ethical implications of this shift in true crime content creation. I argue that AI true crime videos exacerbate the moral ambiguity assigned to the genre given their lack of regulation and commitment to journalistic integrity.
