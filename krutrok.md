## Crisis in the Feed: Platformed Misinformation After the Örebro School Shooting

The 2025 school shooting in Örebro, Sweden, sparked a chaotic and emotionally charged digital response. This paper examines the circulation of information (and misinformation) across three distinct platforms—X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and Flashback—during the first week following the attack. We explore how platform affordances shape rumor dynamics and crowd-sourced meaning-making in the absence of timely official information. Our findings reveal how misinformation flourishes in fragmented information environments: X enabled amplification by political opinion leaders, Flashback encouraged speculative investigation through pseudonymity, and TikTok facilitated emotional storytelling via eyewitness videos. By analyzing how narratives are constructed and spread across these spaces, we argue that mass shootings are not only crises of violence but also crises of information, raising urgent questions about platform responsibility, crisis communication, and the governance of digital public discourse in the wake of traumatic events.
