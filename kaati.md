## When Words Become Warnings: Assessing Threats in Online Spaces

Distinguishing between individuals who post threats online and those who pose a genuine risk of violence is a critical challenge for law enforcement and security professionals. As digital platforms increasingly serve as spaces for radicalization and operational planning, the need to identify early warning signals in online communication is more urgent than ever. In this talk, we explore how threat assessment of written communication can inform the prediction and prevention of targeted violence. Drawing on empirical data and real-world examples, we demonstrate methods for detecting and analyzing key risk indicators in online content. The findings provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to strengthen early detection, guide interventions, and enhance the prevention of violence in digital environments.
