## Tinker, Teamer, OSINT Spy: Towards a Typology of Antifascist Doxxers in Three Cases

It is now widely appreciated that contempoary antifa groups use an array of digital tactics against their adversaries including, among others, ‘doxxing’ or ‘ID-ing’–that is publicly revealing the identity and private information of far-right activists via social media platforms with the intention that this negatively impacts their personal lives, mainly in terms of their employment conditions and social relationships. However, doxxing has not been studied in detail in antifascist settings and its discussion in these settings has, to date, usually relied primarily on modes of ethnographic and content analysis. In this presentation I will begin exploring antifiascist doxxing in more detail using research data generated via prolonged online, text-based interviews with three prominent North American antifascist doxxers that were conducted anonymously via the Signal and Wire messaging apps between March 2021 and February 2022. In this presentation I will use these interviews not only to delineate common and contrasting approaches to the practice of antifascist doxing and, in turn, to suggest a nascent typology of antifascist doxxers but also to reflect on the practicalities, benefits and challenges of conducting interviews with antifa activists in this way.
