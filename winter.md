## The dark side of mundanity in security technologies

As digital-plural policing expands through laws, policies and technologies (e.g., drones, facial recognition), it also delegates responsibilities to local and private actors. Municipalities and schools increasingly procure private expertise and products to meet legal demands for crime prevention. This presentation explores how digital security technologies (apps, sensors, platforms) operate beneath the radar of traditional policing. Embedded in techno-optimism and framed as “soft technologies”, they promise efficiency while being cheap, easy to install, and non-intrusive. Yet soft technologies illustrate a dark side of mundanity. Implemented in everyday practices, they obscure power relations and unequal productions of risk and control as they not only observe but also shape spatial and social imaginaries of threat, producing certain groups, behaviors, and places as risky. The digital-plural complex produces social order in multiple ways, raising questions about what forms of risk emerge not only in exceptional moments, but also in the mundane use of security technologies.
