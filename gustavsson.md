## Shame and Sanction: Social Control Practices in Darknet Communities 

> The Wild West had rules, even in the absence of law. Don’t draw first… - Flynn, respondent, senior member

The Darknet is often perceived as an infamous digital wild west where “anything goes,” enabling deviance and criminality beyond the reach of state or law enforcement. However, this dissertation challenges that notion by drawing on four years of digital ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with administrators, moderators, senior members, and lurkers. Even though the Darknet forums are beyond the reach of any state or law enforcement, the findings demonstrate that the Darknet is far from a lawless space; instead, it operates through a complex system of digitally articulated social control. Rule violations are met with penalties ranging from reputational damage to forum exclusion, with humor, humiliation, and insults serving as nuanced tools for social regulation. Ultimately, this dissertation reframes the Darknet as an intricate ecosystem where social control is enacted through both formal rules and community-driven mechanisms.
