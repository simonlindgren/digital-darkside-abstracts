## Conceptualizing Digital Force â€“ Police hacking in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands as a step towards reasserting a digital monopoly of force?
 
In recent years, several European states have given law enforcement agencies the mandate to hack digital devices to enable surveillance and circumvent encrypted communication channels. Using Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands as case studies we aim to conceptualize how force can be understood in the digital domain, and whether the legal developments relating to police hacking can be understood as a step towards reasserting a police monopoly of such force in the digital domain, and what this entails from the perspective of Weberian theory.
