## Shadow libraries: Academic publishing as an oligopoly
 
In the face of a morally injust system, illicit initiatives have come to replace conventional dissemination of academic literature, these are called Shadow Libraries. Shadow libraries are digital platforms designed to spread, share and archive copyrighted literature. Their spread spans from dark corners of the web to anchor points on the clearnet. To facilitate the technical and social infrastructure required to sustain the websites, shadow library administrators make use of both formal and informal economic methods to finance their platforms. This presentation aims to illustrate the different nuances in ambitions and financing that shadow libraries present, ultimately showing how initiatives with significant crowd sourced support navigate legislative injunction.
