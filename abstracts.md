## Swap, Undress, Generate: The role of AI in Facilitating Image-based Sexual Abuse


Artificial intelligence has now became ubiquitous, creeping into almost every aspect of everyday life. Inevitably, AI also started to facilitate gender-based violence in innovative ways, though intersecting with deeply rooted and long-lasting power structures and gender inequalities. Technologies that allow users to swap faces or “undress” individuals with a click have become more accessible and easy to use. At the same time, generative AI is increasingly being used to create and modify images, texts, and sounds, opening up new forms of harm. This talk offers insights into how the increasing accessibility and power of AI is shaping the landscape of technology-facilitated gender based violence, particularly image-based sexual abuse. It is guided by a central question: how can we understand the entangled relationship between AI and gender-based violence at the intersection of gender and platform studies?
