## Swedish Police’s Social Media — A gray area and its implications for public safety

This study is a continuation of my dissertation, Communicating a sense of public safety: The case of the Swedish Police Authority’s strategic social media communication (2025), and reflects on the grey areas of the Swedish Police’s social media communication. By grey area, I refer to how official communication co-exists with police coworkers’ personal thoughts and reflections, which can affect public trust and safety. The Swedish Police’s abundance of social media accounts (official and unofficial) and the general interest in policing increases the Police Authority’s eagerness to be seen digitally. On the one hand, the police share and inform the public about local and national activities. However, simultaneously, police coworkers utilize their position to promote personal thoughts or content from various interventions. This can create tension in what is communicated, for whom, and why. Thus, I will present three examples concerning the Swedish Police’s social media that problematizes this grey area, and that can have implications for public safety.
